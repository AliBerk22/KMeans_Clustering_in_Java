# KMeans Clustering in Java
Interactive KMeans Clustering Simulation in Java

## Running The Program
Compile and run "KMeans.java"

## How To Use The Simulation?
Press "AddData" button and then click to desired postition. It will add data to screen (Could be added as desired). Press "AddCenter" button and then click to desired postition. It will add colorful centers to screen (Could be added as desired). After the adding part, press "NextStep" button. It will make the next process of the clustering. After few presses, It will cluster. Press "Reset" to start over.

## How Is It Working? 
Calculates all data's distances to the centers. Then cluster them to corresponding center (nearest center). After one step of the clustering, It estimates new clusters' centroids. Then moves the current centers to their new centroids (For each different centroid). After the movement, calculates all data's distances to centers again and clusters them. Repeats this procces until clustering is done.
